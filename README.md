## ✍️ Task Observations

The task focused on exploring **Bootstrap 5** components and remixing them into unique, responsive web layouts.  
I observed that Bootstrap simplifies UI building through reusable components and grid utilities, helping developers focus on design creativity rather than starting from scratch.

## 💡 My Approach

I began by reviewing Bootstrap examples, identifying components suitable for a cafe theme, and then customized them using inline CSS.  
The three pages (Home, About, Contact) were designed to maintain visual consistency and clear navigation.  
Finally, I tested and deployed the project to Vercel for live access.
